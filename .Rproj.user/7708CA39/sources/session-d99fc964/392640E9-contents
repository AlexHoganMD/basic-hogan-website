## Welcome!

We are excited to have you visit the Hogan Lab. We are a diverse group of students, researchers, and collaborators working to better understand the drivers of pediatric morbidity and mortality through the lens of social determinants of health.


## Our Focus

Our mission is to identify and address modifiable factors that can improve children's lives. We are called to help the most vulnerable patients and reduce inequalities wherever we can.

## Our Approach

Our approach is methodologically diverse - we use whatever scientific methods are necessary to create rigorous, reproducible, and transparent research. As a member of our research community, you'll find:

- Innovative health services research
- Community-engaged research approaches
- Focus on pediatric health outcomes
- Commitment to health equity
