## Scientific Mission

Our lab's mission is to reduce pediatric morbidity and mortality using health services research (HSR) and community-engaged research (CEnR/CBPR) approaches.

### We accomplish this by:
- Identifying modifiable factors that influence child health outcomes
- Partnering with communities to develop effective interventions
- Translating research findings into actionable policy recommendations
- Building evidence for interventions that reduce health disparities

## Vision

We envision a future where all children have the opportunity to thrive, regardless of their social or economic circumstances. We strive to be a leading research group that:

- Bridges the gap between academic research and community needs
- Develops innovative solutions to complex pediatric health challenges
- Trains the next generation of health services researchers
- Creates lasting positive change in pediatric healthcare delivery and outcomes
